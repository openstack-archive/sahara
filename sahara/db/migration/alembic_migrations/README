The migrations in the alembic/versions contain the changes needed to migrate
from older Savanna releases to newer versions. A migration occurs by executing
a script that details the changes needed to upgrade/downgrade the database. The
migration scripts are ordered so that multiple scripts can run sequentially to
update the database. The scripts are executed by Savanna's migration wrapper
which uses the Alembic library to manage the migration. Savanna supports
migration from Icehouse or later.


If you are a deployer or developer and want to migrate from Icehouse to later
release you must first add version tracking to the database:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savaanna.conf stamp icehouse
```

You can upgrade to the latest database version via:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf upgrade head
```

To check the current database version:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf current
```

To create a script to run the migration offline:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf upgrade head --sql
```

To run the offline migration between specific migration versions:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf upgrade \
    <start version>:<end version> --sql
```

Upgrade the database incrementally:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf upgrade --delta \
    <# of revs>
```

Downgrade the database by a certain number of revisions:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf downgrade --delta \
    <# of revs>
```

Create new revision:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf revision \
    -m "description of revision" --autogenerate
```

Create a blank file:
```
$ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf revision \
    -m "description of revision"
```

To verify that the timeline does branch, you can run this command:
```
    $ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf check_migration
```

If the migration path does branch, you can find the branch point via:
```
    $ savanna-db-manage --config-file /path/to/savanna.conf history
```
