If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack,
you must follow the steps in this page:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html

You can find more Sahara-specific info in our How To Participate guide:

   http://docs.openstack.org/developer/sahara/devref/how_to_participate.html

Once those steps have been completed, changes to OpenStack
should be submitted for review via the Gerrit tool, following
the workflow documented at:

   http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/sahara
